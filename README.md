# BezierCurveShape
This SwiftUI example defines and visualizes a generalized Bézier curve function for three or more control points. The code includes helper functions to compute the binomial coefficient and a single point on the curve using the Bernstein basis. A custom Shape, BezierCurveShape, is then used within a SwiftUI view to draw both the control polygon and the Bézier curve.
